# 🌾 CropIntel
**Crops Supply-Demand Forecasting with ML/DL**

CropIntel is a machine learning and deep learning project focused on forecasting **crop supply**, **demand**, and **optimal pricing** using international trade data. The aim is to empower **Indian farmers** with data-driven insights to support better market decisions.

---

## 🚀 Project Goals

- 📊 Predict **supply** and **demand** of crops based on historical trade and market data.
- 💰 Estimate **optimal pricing** using economic and seasonal indicators.
- ☁️ Build a **cloud-based ML pipeline** (GCP) with end-to-end automation.
- 🌱 Deliver insights through APIs or dashboards to benefit farmers and agri-businesses.
